# php-form-validation
Framework Agnostic version of PHP form validation originally based on the work done here: 
https://github.com/Wixel/GUMP

It looks as though the project has been neglected for some time, so we intend to build upon on some of the concepts, add some functionality and see where it goes. 

The intent is to have an array of fields with validations imposed upon those fields.

We want the extensibility of the class to be much easier than adding on static methods as well. So we will remove that functionality and provide custom ways and examples of how to extend the class. The documentation itself will also become more robust as the project moves along as well.
